## Tested Browser Platforms
* The demo's in this RLO have been tested on the latest versions of the desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
* The site will work on most mobile browsers supporting WebGL as well but the demos that require keyboard (namely PONG) will not - touch support needs to be added for this to happen.
